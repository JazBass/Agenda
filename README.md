Agenda in JAVA, with data bases connection.

In the application we make a connection to a local MySQL DB. We can add, modify and delete contacts with MySQL statements. In the code you must enter the name
of the database within the connect() function in the Agenda.java class line 115 and the user and password of the same in line 75 of the controlbd.java class also corresponding to the connect() function.

In addition, an access file (version 2010) is created with a record for the login in which we also make a connection and a query to "enable" the agenda.
